### Docker configuration
At this moment this repositorie contains the following docker containers:

<details>
  <summary> Portainer </summary>
  
  [Portainer](https://github.com/Ramon-87/docker-compose/tree/main/portainer) is a GUI to manage docker containers.

<details>
  <summary> Wishlist </summary>

  [Wishlist](https://github.com/Ramon-87/docker-compose/tree/main/wishlist) is created as a wishlist for Christmas. But it can also be used for other celebrations. I'm still looking for a better and cleaner solution.

The docker-compose configuration files in my homeserver are mostly deployed with Portainer.
